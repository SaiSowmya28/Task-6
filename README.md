# 🚀 Why This Project Matters

Many real-world systems rely on:

- Capacity monitoring
- Resource allocation
- Occupancy analysis
- Threshold-based alerts
- Operational control

This repository demonstrates the ability to design such systems using structured Python logic.

These skills are highly relevant for Data Analyst and Python-based roles where rule-based automation and monitoring systems are common.
